This is my first ever blog post, on my first ever personal site. This post is just to make sure everything is working. Rather than using an existing site template or theme, I've decided to start from scratch with Vue + Vuetify + Vitepress. It's sort of refreshing in a way, and you feel a bit like a craftman as you finetune every last element to perfection (based on your own view of course).

This blog will be where I post my personal ramblings and projects, and where I experiment with new things. At the time that I wrote this post (on 11/Feb/2023), I'm still on vitepress 1.0.0-alpha.36, so a lot of changes might be ahead for this site (but this blog post won't change).
